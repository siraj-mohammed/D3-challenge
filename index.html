          <h3>Poverty and the Uninsured:</h3>
          <p><em>Adults in low-income households are certainly more likely to be uninsured than people in higher income
            households,
            but not all uninsured adults are in families with low incomes. Texas has the highest number of uninsured
            adults,
            but does not have the highest number of families in poverty. Therefore, there must be other factors that
            contribute to whether an individual is insured, or not.</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="article" id="my_poverty_smokes" style="display: none;">
          <h3>Poverty and Smoking:</h3>
          <p><em>In the U.S., people living below the poverty level have higher rates of cigarette smoking than the general
            population. However, poverty does not appear to be the only factor
            that contributes to the likelihood of cigarette smoking. States like California and New York fall around the
            median in terms of poverty rates, but
            have some of the lowest rates of smoking relative to their populations.</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="article" id="my_poverty_obesity" style="display: none;">
          <h3>Poverty and Obesity:</h3>
          <p><em>The U.S. is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and accordingly has high obesity rates;
            one-third of the population has obesity plus another third is overweight. It has been suggested that
            individuals who live in
            impoverished regions have poor access to fresh food. Poverty-dense areas are oftentimes called “food
            deserts,”
            implying diminished access to fresh food. Again, there are states, such as New Hampshire, that have very low
            poverty rates but still have relatively
            higher rates of obesity.</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="article" id="my_age_healthcare" style="display: none;">
          <h3>Age and the Uninsured:</h3>
          <p><em>Compared with other age groups, young adults are the most likely to go without coverage. This can be
            expected since young adults tend to be much healthier than other age groups,
            and can typically risk being uninsured. Massachusetts appears to have the lowest number of uninsured
            individuals, while Texas has the highest rate, but a much lower median age.
            An interesting case is Florida, where the median age is much higher than other states at 42, but has much
            higher rates of poverty.</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="article" id="my_age_smokes" style="display: none;">
          <h3>Age and Smoking:</h3>
          <p><em>It does appear that states with a large proportion of older age groups tend to have the highest rates of
            smoking. Perhaps states where the median age is higher
            have individuals that have smoked for many years, and have chosen not to quit. As opposed to states like
            Utah
            where the median age is very low, and much of the population doesn't smoke at all.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="article" id="my_age_obesity" style="display: none;">
          <h3>Age and Obesity:</h3>
          <p><em>There does appear to be slight correlation between a states median age and level of obesity. It seems that
            higher age groups are more succeptible to being obese, but that is likely not always the case.
            Older age groups are typically less active than younger groups, and would therefore do much to explain why
            an
            older person is more likely to be obese. Clearly there are other factors, like poverty and income that may
            affect obesity levels.</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="article" id="my_income_healthcare" style="display: none;">
          <h3>Income and the Uninsured:</h3>
          <p><em>Many uninsured people cite the high cost of insurance as the main reason they lack coverage. Most uninsured
            people are in low-income families and have at least one worker in the family.
            Reflecting the more limited availability of public coverage in some states. This is quite clearly the case
            in
            Texas where the level of uninsured individuals is the highest in the country.</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="article" id="my_income_smokes" style="display: none;">
          <h3>Income and Smoking:</h3>
          <p><em>A household's income contributes directly to the level of poverty. Therefore, just as states with high
            rates
            of poverty tend to have a greater population of individuals that smoke, states with lower median household
            income will tend
            to also have higher rates of smoking. States with relatively higher median incomes have some of the lowest
            rates of smoking.</em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="article" id="my_income_obesity" style="display: none;">
          <h3>Income and Obesity:</h3>
          <p><em>Overall obesity prevalence does tend to decrease with increased levels of income. Just as poverty affects
            the
            availability of healthy food options, as does income. Lower income residents liekly do not have the same
            access to low cost healthy food choices
            as does higher income groups.</em></p>
